# C3-Script-Library
## Introduction
This is a library of custom functions and classes for Construct 3. I create helpful scripts that solve common use-cases. Feel free to browse the documentation and use any of these you might find helpful!

These scripts are recommended for users who are comfortable with JavaScript and Construct 3. If you're not comfortable with Construct 3, we recommend you start with the [Construct 3 tutorials](https://www.construct.net/en/tutorials).

### Installation
Each script has a `Setup` section that will tell you how to use the script in your project.

These scripts were written with modularity in mind and the Setup sections are designed to get you up and running. However, please feel free to tweak these scripts to fit your needs. If you end up making something even better, please consider contributing it back to the community! We'd love to see what you come up with!

# Documentation
The name of the JS files are used as headers in this readme so you can easily ctrl+F to search for the docs on the exact script you're looking for.

## spriteGrid.js
This script allows you to create a grid of sprites. It also allows you to create a grid of sprites from an animation. Useful for Inventory Systems, Item Selection, and more!

## mouseHover.js
Simple script that allows you to detect when the mouse is hovering over an object. Useful for creating hover effects. The default effect is a small scale up Tween but you can easily change this to whatever you want.
